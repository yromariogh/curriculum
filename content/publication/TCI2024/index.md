abstract: Coded aperture snapshot spectral imager (CASSI), efficiently captures 3D spectral images by sensing 2D projections of the scene. While CASSI offers a substantial reduction in acquisition time, compared to traditional scanning optical systems, it requires a reconstruction post-processing step. Furthermore, to obtain high-quality reconstructions, an accurate propagation model is required. Notably, CASSI exhibits a variant spatio-spectral sensor response, making it difficult to acquire an accurate propagation model. To address these inherent limitations, this work proposes to learn a deep non-linear fully differentiable propagation model that can be used as a regularizer within an optimization-based reconstruction algorithm. The proposed approach trains the non-linear spatially-variant propagation model using paired compressed measurements and spectral images, by employing side information only in the calibration step. From the deep propagation model incorporation into a plug-and-play alternating direction method of multipliers framework, our proposed method outperforms traditional CASSI linear-based models. Extensive simulations and a testbed implementation validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.

### Simulation results

![screen reader text](/TCI2024/Ys_by_deg_level_white+Mx.png "Fig. 3.   Simulated measurement $\mathbf{y}_i$ for each degradation level $D_i$. (b) Absolute error of each simulated measurement with respect to the non-degradation scenario $\mathbf{y}_0=\mathbf{Hx}$. (c) Improved measurement obtained with the $\text{DNL}^2$ model. (d) Absolute error of each simulated measurement with respect to the improved measurement. The evident reduction in error across degradation levels underscores its robustness and independence.")

![screen reader text](/TCI2024/ARAD_METRICS_NL+SNR.png "Fig. 4.   (a) Simulation results and ablation studies of $\lambda_1$ under each degradation level in the ARAD dataset. Note the improvement in the different metrics by increasing the proposed regularizer influence through the coefficient $\lambda_1$, with $\lambda_1=0$ as the baseline PnP with the linear propagation model. (b) Average results of different testing images evaluating the impact of additional noise at the highest degradation level $D_4$ from the ARAD dataset.")
