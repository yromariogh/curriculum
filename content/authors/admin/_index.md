## About Me

I am a Master's student in Systems Engineering at Universidad Industrial de Santander and a dedicated young researcher. I graduated Cum Laude from the Systems Engineering program in 2023 at the Universidad Industrial de Santander. My undergraduate thesis received the Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis Award. In the same year, I was awarded the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS) Scholarship. My research areas include computational imaging, signal processing, and deep learning. I am deeply passionate about research, driven by the belief that technology and innovation can create significant positive impacts.
